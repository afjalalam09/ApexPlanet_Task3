Task 3: Deep-Dive Analysis Report

1. Core KPIs Defined:

Total Sales: $2,261,536.78 (Sum of all revenue).

Total Orders: 4,922 (Unique count of Order IDs).

Avg Order Value (AOV): $459.48 (Total Sales / Total Orders).

Unique Customers: 793 (Total distinct customers).

2. Deep-Dive Methodology: I performed a Segmentation Analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Model. This helps in categorizing customers based on how recently they shopped, how often they shop, and how much they spend.

3. Key Insights:

Best Customers: 35 customers are in the top tier and should be targeted with loyalty rewards.

Lost Customers: 158 customers haven't purchased in a long time and need re-engagement strategies.

Standard Customers: The majority (330) are regular buyers.
