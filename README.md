## 📝 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Apex Planet Data Analytics Internship (Task 3)**. The objective was to perform a deep-dive analysis of sales data to identify customer behavior patterns. 

I utilized **Python (Pandas)** to perform **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** and developed an **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** to visualize the findings. This helps the business identify "Best Customers" for rewards and "Lost Customers" for re-engagement campaigns.

## 🔍 Methodology: RFM Analysis
I used the **RFM technique** to score customers based on three factors:
1.  **Recency (R):** How recently did the customer purchase?
2.  **Frequency (F):** How often do they purchase?
3.  **Monetary (M):** How much do they spend?

Based on these scores, customers were grouped into segments:
* **Best Customers:** High spending, frequent buyers, bought recently.
* **Loyal Customers:** Frequent buyers.
* **Big Spenders:** High monetary value.
* **Lost Customers:** Haven't bought in a long time.
* **Standard Customers:** Average behavior.

## 📊 Dashboard Features (Power BI)
The interactive dashboard includes:
* **KPI Cards:** Displaying Total Sales ($2.26M), Total Orders (4,922), and Unique Customers (793).
* **Donut Chart:** Visualizing the distribution of customer segments (Best vs. Lost).
* **Interactive Slicer:** Allows filtering the entire dashboard by Segment (e.g., clicking "Best Customers" filters the sales data).
* **Bar & Line Charts:** Trend analysis over time and sales by category.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **Total Revenue:** $2,261,536.78
* **Best Customers:** We identified **35 high-value customers** who contribute significantly to revenue.
* **Retention Risk:** There are **158 Lost Customers** who require immediate marketing attention.
* **Average Order Value:** $459.48

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download the `Task_3_Power_BI_Customer_Segmentation.pbix` file.
2.  Open it in **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.
3.  Ensure the data source (`cleaned_data.csv` and `Task3_RFM_Analysis.csv`) paths are correct if you want to refresh the data.
4.  Interact with the **Segment Slicer** on the left to explore the data.
